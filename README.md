FinStat.sk API client
=====================

This is an API client for [finstat.sk](https://finstat.sk/), Slovakian company register.

How to install
--------------

Install package [`hubipe/finstat`](https://packagist.org/packages/hubipe/finstat) with [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```

How to use
----------

Using client is easy - all you have to do is initiate `FinStat` class by passing it request client, API key and private
API key:

```php
<?php
use Hubipe\FinStat\FinStat;
use Hubipe\FinStat\Request\GuzzleRequestClient;

$requestClient = new GuzzleRequestClient();
$client = new FinStat(
	$requestClient,
	$apiKey,
	$privateKey
);
```

When client is instantiated, you can start querying API:

```php
$detailResult = $client->detail('36631124');
$autocompleteResult = $client->autocomplete('Slovenská pošta');
$czAutocompleteResult = $client->czAutocomplete('Česká pošta');
```
